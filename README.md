### Installing Dependencies

#### Arch Linux
```bash/zsh/fish
sudo pacman -Syu ffmpeg fzf yt-dlp
```

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash/zsh/fish
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg fzf yt-dlp
```

#### Fedora

```

#### macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash/zsh/fish
brew install ffmpeg fzf yt-dlp
```

#### NixOS
Add the following to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  ffmpeg
  fzf
  yt-dlp
];
```
Then apply the changes:
```bash/zsh/fish
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

## Building the Executable

To compile `neko-dl.sh` into a standalone executable binary (`neko-dl`), use the [shc](https://github.com/neurobin/shc) shell script compiler.

### Install shc

#### Arch Linux
```bash/zsh/fish
sudo pacman -S shc
```

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash/zsh/fish
sudo apt update
sudo apt install shc
```

#### Fedora
```bash/zsh/fish
sudo dnf install shc
```

#### macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash/zsh/fish
brew install shc
```

### Compile the Binary

```bash/zsh/fish
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will compile `neko-dl.sh` into an executable binary named `neko-dl`. You can then run it directly or move it into a location on your `$PATH`.

> Optional: Use `strip neko-dl` to reduce binary size.


## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
```bash/zsh/fish
chmod +x neko-dl
```

2. Run the executable:
```bash/zsh/fish
./neko-dl
```
3. Setup executable for system wide usage:

## BASH instuctions
